# WKT utilities in R
`wicket` is a little package to make handling Well-Known Text (WKT) data easier in R, letting you easily:

1. Validate WKT data;
2. Generate WKT bounding boxes from R data types, and;
3. Convert `sp` objects (particularly SpatialPolygons and SpatialPolygonDataFrames) into WKT.

The package is mostly built out of C++, and as such can perform all of these operations extremely fast, to
the tune of 100,000 sp-to-WKT conversions in just over a second. For more information, see the introductory vignette.
